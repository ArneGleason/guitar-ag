# DSP Notes

## Purpose

Use this file to capture physical-modeling ideas, experiments, parameter ranges, artifacts, and sound-design learnings.

## Initial DSP Direction

Start with a simple Karplus-Strong or digital waveguide-style string model.

The first goal is musical, stable, expressive behavior rather than perfect guitar realism.

## Suggested MVP Signal Flow

```text
MIDI/MPE event
  -> voice allocation
  -> physical string voice
  -> pickup/tone shaping
  -> output gain
```

## String Voice Ideas

A basic string voice may include:

- delay line based on target frequency
- excitation/noise burst based on velocity
- damping filter in the feedback path
- fractional delay or interpolation for pitch accuracy
- smoothing when pitch bend changes delay length
- release damping for note-off behavior

## Pluck Parameters

Possible controls:

- pluck force
- pluck position
- pick hardness
- damping
- sustain
- brightness

## Electric Guitar Tone Ideas

The MVP should aim for a DI-style electric guitar tone.

Possible simplifications:

- pickup position as harmonic filtering
- tone knob as low-pass shaping
- bridge pickup as brighter/thinner
- neck pickup as warmer/rounder
- output gain with safe limiting or headroom

## Realism Research

See `docs/realism-vision.md` for collected research links and longer-term hypotheses around string/fret interaction, pickup modeling, player interpretation, and hybrid/neural directions.

## Known Risks

- Karplus-Strong can sound like a generic plucked synth if not shaped carefully.
- Pitch bending a delay line can cause clicks or zipper noise if not smoothed.
- Excess brightness can become harsh through amp sims.
- Too much damping can kill sustain before expression feels useful.
- Too much sustain can make the model feel synth-like instead of guitar-like.
